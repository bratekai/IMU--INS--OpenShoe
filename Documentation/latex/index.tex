\hypertarget{index_sec_intro}{}\section{\-Introduction}\label{index_sec_intro}
\-Open\-Shoe is an academic project for creating an open source embedded foot-\/mounted \-I\-N\-S implementation. \-The project contain both hardware and software components all of which are documented and released under open source licenses. \-Our motivation for the project has been to 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item \-Create a working prototype for ourself. 
\item \-Give other researchers a short-\/cut to a working implementation. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\-The former is a necessity for our future research activities within indoor positioning. \-The planned use span from being a subcomponent in larger positioning system to being used as a stand alone component for research within the foot-\/mounted \-I\-N\-S field.

\-The latter comes from our observations of many poor implementations and measurement setups and our own experience of all small details that can go wrong. \-The value of an embedded implementation is the modularity and the small weight, bulk, and price in comparison with the typical sensor-\/plus-\/laptop research systems. \-This alleviates the work of integration in larger real-\/time navigation systems and makes it possibility to equip a large number of users with sensors for field performance tests and cooperative navigation studies. \-Our hope is that this implementation will save time, sweat, and tears for navigation researchers and facilitate the use of foot-\/mounted inertial navigation by researchers not specialized in inertial navigation, e.\-g. in fields such as biomedical engineering, behavioral science, and ubiquitous computing.

\-The initial part of the project is carried out during the fall and winter of 2011-\/2012 by \-K\-T\-H (\-K\-T\-H \-Royal \-Institute of \-Technology, \-Stockholm, \-Sweden) researchers working at \-I\-I\-Sc (\-Indian \-Institutet of \-Science, \-Bangalore, \-India). \-The project is a part of a joint \-Indo-\/\-Swedish project between \-Signal \-Processing \-Lab \-K\-T\-H, \-Statistical \-Signal \-Processing \-Lab \-I\-I\-Sc, and \-V\-L\-S\-I \-Circuits and \-Systems \-Lab \-I\-I\-Sc.\hypertarget{index_doc}{}\section{\-This documentation}\label{index_doc}
