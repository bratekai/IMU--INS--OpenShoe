\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-This module includes \-U\-S\-B \-Stack \-Device implementation. \-The stack is divided in three parts\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \-U\-S\-B \-Device \-Controller (\-U\-D\-C) provides \-U\-S\-B chapter 9 compliance
\item \-U\-S\-B \-Device \-Interface (\-U\-D\-I) provides \-U\-S\-B \-Class compliance
\item \-U\-S\-B \-Device \-Driver (\-U\-D\-D) provides \-U\-S\-B \-Driver for each \-A\-V\-R product
\end{DoxyItemize}

\-Many \-U\-S\-B \-Device applications can be implemented on \-A\-V\-R products. \-Atmel provides many application notes for different applications\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \-A\-V\-R4900, provides general information about \-Device \-Stack
\item \-A\-V\-R4901, explains how to create a new class
\item \-A\-V\-R4902, explains how to create a composite device
\item \-A\-V\-R49xx, all device classes provided in \-A\-S\-F have an application note
\end{DoxyItemize}

\-A basic \-U\-S\-B knowledge is required to understand the \-U\-S\-B \-Device \-Class application notes (\-H\-I\-D,\-M\-S,\-C\-D\-C,\-P\-H\-D\-C,...). \-Then, to create an \-U\-S\-B device with only one class provided by \-A\-S\-F, refer directly to the application note corresponding to this \-U\-S\-B class. \-The \-U\-S\-B \-Device application note for \-New \-Class and \-Composite is dedicated to advanced \-U\-S\-B users.
