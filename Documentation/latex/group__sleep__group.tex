\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-This is a stub on the \-A\-V\-R \-U\-C3 \-Power \-Manager(\-P\-M) for the sleepmgr service.

\begin{DoxyNote}{\-Note}
\-To minimize the code overhead, these functions do not feature interrupt-\/protected access since they are likely to be called inside interrupt handlers or in applications where such protection is not necessary. \-If such protection is needed, it must be ensured by the calling code. 
\end{DoxyNote}
