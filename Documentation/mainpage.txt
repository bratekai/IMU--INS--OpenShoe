 \section sec_intro Introduction

OpenShoe is an academic project for creating an open source embedded foot-mounted INS implementation. The project contain both hardware and software components all of which are documented and released under open source licenses. Our motivation for the project has been to
<ol>
	<li>Create a working prototype for ourself.</li>
	<li>Give other researchers a short-cut to a working implementation.</li>
</ol>
The former is a necessity for our future research activities within indoor positioning. The planned use span from being a subcomponent in larger positioning system to being used as a stand alone component for research within the foot-mounted INS field.

The latter comes from our observations of many poor implementations and measurement setups and our own experience of all small details that can go wrong. The value of an embedded implementation is the modularity and the small weight, bulk, and price in comparison with the typical sensor-plus-laptop research systems. This alleviates the work of integration in larger real-time navigation systems and makes it possibility to equip a large number of users with sensors for field performance tests and cooperative navigation studies. Our hope is that this implementation will save time, sweat, and tears for navigation researchers and facilitate the use of foot-mounted inertial navigation by researchers not specialized in inertial navigation, e.g. in fields such as  biomedical engineering, behavioral science, and ubiquitous computing.

The initial part of the project is carried out during the fall and winter of 2011-2012 by KTH (KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden) researchers working at IISc (Indian Institutet of Science, Bangalore, India). The project is a part of a joint Indo-Swedish project between Signal Processing Lab KTH, Statistical Signal Processing Lab IISc, and VLSI Circuits and Systems Lab IISc.
